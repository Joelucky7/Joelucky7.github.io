        <h2>Our Goal </h2>
        <p>We believe that there is nothing gets better then<br>
        a river trip to get away from the busy world.<br>
        That is why we subscribe to
        the dry oar philosophy<br>
        of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking<br>
        time to look around and notice the beauty that surrounds<br>
        the rivers we love. </p>
        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>White Water Rafting! Our process is simple pre pay online<br>

            you wont want to miss. Mothers and fathers can sit back and<br>

    <h3>Rivers & Rapids:</h3>
    <p>That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all<br>
        things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes<br>
        when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of<br>
        waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that<br>
        always follows even more. </p>
    <h3>Invitation </h3>
    <p>We invite you to come relax with us on one of the amazing rivers<br>
        we visit. Check out our trips and let us know which one best suits<br>
        you. We're waiting to hear from you! </p>
