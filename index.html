            <p> <strong>We believe</strong> that there is nothing gets better then
            a river trip to get away from the busy world.
            That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy
            of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking
            time to look around and notice the beauty that surrounds
            the rivers we love. </p>

            <h3> Rivers &amp; Rapids</h3>
            <p id="top-row">
            That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes
            <br> when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of
            <br> waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that
            <br> always follows even more. </p>
